# Introduction

Wardrobe memory is meant to keep you from repeating commonly used outfits with the same group of people you intend to meet.

Keep a diary of significant outfits and never double up on a fit again.

# Technologies Used

This app was built as a full stack MERN application. Mongo, Express, React, Node

# Getting started

# [Trello Plan Board](https://trello.com/b/ma7tJmCG/mern-stack-project)

# [Github Repo](https://github.com/nd1391/capstone-project.git)

# [Deployed Wardrobe](https://capstone-wardrobe.onrender.com)

# Unsolved Problems

I initially tried using the Refine framework for this project and had to discontinue the effort when I ran into issues connecting to MongoDB.

My package.json keeps causing an error (Microsoft specific) and has been a huge deterent during development. It is an ESLinter error that persists throughout all of production.

# Future Enhancements

I'd like to add general UI enhancements and styling.
Condense each outfit to be expanded if need be, categorized by date and event name.
Users, once logged in, will have a dashboard load, showing stats of types and colors of clothes they frequently wear.
